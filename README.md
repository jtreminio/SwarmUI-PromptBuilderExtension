# Prompt Builder Extension

A SwarmUI extension for Danbooru tag connoisseurs who definitely aren't making waifus.

![Prompt Builder Extension Logo](https://github.com/jtreminio/SwarmUI-PromptBuilderExtension/blob/main/Assets/logo.png?raw=true)

Build your ideal anime girl (or suspiciously specific scenario) with the click of a button.
Over 25,000 of the most popular Danbooru tags, neatly categorized and sorted by popularity.
Because typing "1girl, blush, maid, sunset" by hand is for amateurs.

## Features

- Browse tags by category and popularity
- Click to add, drag to reorder
- Insert directly into your prompt with `<pbprompt>`
- Auto-gen images as you click buttons!
- Tags link to Danbooru for your full research
- Search tags by typing, like a caveman
- Open in a pop-out window for full creative... efficiency
- BUTTONS!

Make your workflow faster, your tags cleaner, and your shame slightly more organized.
